# Overview
_Woven_ is a TypeScript-based computer algebra library.

## Type Guards
### isJSNum(𝑥: _any_) → _boolean_
Returns true if ${x}$ is a JavaScript number; false otherwise. This function will return false if ${x}$ is `NaN`.

### isJSInt(𝑥: _any_) → _boolean_
Returns true if ${x}$ is a JavaScript number and is an integer; false otherwise.

## Numeric Analysis 
Within the code base, the following methods are implemented in `math.numerics.ts`.

### lerp(${I}$: _[number,number]_, ${v}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Given the interval ${I = [a,b],}$ with ${a \in \reals}$ and ${b \in \reals,}$ returns the number between ${a}$ and ${b}$ at the specified increment ${v.}$ 

### clamp(${a}$: _number_, ${v}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns ${v}$ if and only if ${a \lt v \lt b.}$ If ${v \lt a,}$ returns ${a.}$ If ${b \lt v,}$ returns ${b.}$ As its name suggests, the `clamp` function ensures ${v}$ stays within the interval ${[a,b].}$

### ilerp(${I}$: [_number_, _number_], ${v}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
The _inverse lerp_: Given the interval ${[a,b]}$ with ${a \in \reals}$ and ${b \in \reals,}$ returns the distance between ${v}$ and ${a,}$ in terms of the percentage (a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive) of the distance between ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### range(${I_1}$: [_number_, _number_], ${I_2}$: [_number_, _number_]) ${\to}$ (x:_number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Given the numeric intervals ${I_1}$ and ${I_2,}$ returns a function that takes a number ${x \in I_1}$ and returns the corresponding number in ${I_2}$ with the same relative distance between the endpoints.

### percent(${a}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns ${a\texttt{\%}}$ of ${b.}$

### uid(${\ell}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns a pseudorandom string of characters from ${a}$ through ${z}$ inclusive, using base ${b.}$

## Number Theory


### rem(${a}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns the integer remainder of ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### mod(${a}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns the _signed remainder_ of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ This function is equivalent to ${a ~\texttt{\%}~ b}$ in JavaScript.

### gcd(${a}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns the greatest common denominator of ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### quot(${a}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns the integer quotient of ${a}$ and ${b,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are assumed to be integers. That is, ${\lfloor a/b \rfloor.}$

## Set Theory
Within the code base, the following methods are implemented in `math.set.ts`.

### tuple(...${data}$: ${T}$) ${\to}$ ${T}$
Given a comma-separated list of data of generic type ${T,}$ returns a tuple of type ${T.}$ This function is used primarily for type-checking, since TypeScript cannot infer tuple types in certain cases.

## Linear Algebra
Within the code base, the following methods are implemented in `math.linear.ts`.
