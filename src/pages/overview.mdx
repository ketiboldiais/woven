# Overview
_Woven_ is a TypeScript-based computer algebra library.

## Type Guards
Woven’s type guard functions are used throughout the code base for type checking.

### isJSNum(𝑥: _any_) → _boolean_
Returns true if ${x}$ is a JavaScript number; false otherwise. This function will return false if ${x}$ is `NaN`.

### isJSInt(𝑥: _any_) → _boolean_
Returns true if ${x}$ is a JavaScript number and is an integer; false otherwise.

### Class: `Left<𝑇>`
A box type that wraps a successful output or “safe” data.

### Class: `Right<𝑇>`
A box type that wraps an unsuccessful output or “unsafe” data.

### Type: `Either<𝐴,𝐵>`
A type corresponding to either a generic type ${A}$ or a generic type ${B.}$ This is an alias for `Left<𝐴>|Right<𝐵>`.


## Numeric Analysis 
The numeric analysis functions implement basic numeric methods.

### lerp(𝐼: _[number,number]_, 𝑛: _number_) → _number_
Given the interval ${I = [a,b],}$ with ${a \in \reals}$ and ${b \in \reals,}$ returns the number between ${a}$ and ${b}$ at the specified increment ${n.}$ 

### clamp(${a}$: _number_, ${v}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns ${v}$ if and only if ${a \lt v \lt b.}$ If ${v \lt a,}$ returns ${a.}$ If ${b \lt v,}$ returns ${b.}$ As its name suggests, the `clamp` function ensures ${v}$ stays within the interval ${[a,b].}$

### ilerp(𝐼: [_number_, _number_], 𝑣: _number_) → _number_
The _inverse lerp_: Given the interval ${I = [a,b]}$ with ${a \in \reals}$ and ${b \in \reals,}$ returns the distance between ${v}$ and ${a,}$ in terms of the percentage (a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive) of the distance between ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### range(𝐼₁: [_number_, _number_], 𝐼₂: [_number_, _number_]) → (𝑥:_number_) → _number_
Given the numeric intervals ${I_1}$ and ${I_2,}$ returns a function that takes a number ${x \in I_1}$ and returns the corresponding number in ${I_2}$ with the same relative distance between the endpoints.

### percent(𝑝: _number_, 𝑛: _number_) → _number_
Returns ${p\texttt{\%}}$ of the number ${n.}$

### uid(${\ell}$: _number_, ${b}$: _number_) ${\to}$ _number_
Returns a pseudorandom string of characters from ${a}$ through ${z}$ inclusive, using base ${b.}$

## Number Theory
The number theory functions implement some common number-theoretic operations.

### rem(𝑎: _number_, 𝑏: _number_) → _number_
Returns the integer remainder of ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### mod(𝑎: _number_, 𝑏: _number_) → _number_
Returns the _signed remainder_ of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ This function is equivalent to ${a ~\texttt{\%}~ b}$ in JavaScript.

### quot(𝑎: _number_, 𝑏: _number_) → _number_
Returns the integer quotient of ${a}$ and ${b,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are assumed to be integers. That is, ${\lfloor a/b \rfloor.}$

### gcd(𝑎: _number_, 𝑏: _number_) → _number_
Returns the greatest common denominator of ${a}$ and ${b.}$

### sfrac(𝑞: [_number_, _number_]) → [_number_, _number_]
Where ${q}$ is assumed to be a rational number (represented by a pair of numbers), returns a pair of numbers corresponding to ${q}$ in simplest form.

### fact(𝑛: _number_) → _number_
Returns ${n!.}$

### isEven(𝑛: _number_) → _number_
Returns true if ${n}$ is an even integer; false otherwise.

### isOdd(𝑛: _number_) → _number_
Returns true if ${n}$ is an odd integer; false otherwise.

## Trigonometric Functions
The following functions implement various trigonometric operations.

### sec(𝑥: _number_) → _number_
Returns ${\sec x,}$ where ${x \in \reals.}$

### csc(𝑥: _number_) → _number_
Returns ${\csc x,}$ where ${x \in \reals.}$

## Set Theory
Within the code base, the following methods are implemented in `math.set.ts`.

### tuple(...𝑑: 𝑇) → 𝑇
Given a comma-separated list ${d}$ of generic type ${T,}$ returns a tuple of type ${T.}$ This function is used primarily for type-checking, since TypeScript cannot infer tuple types in certain cases.

## Linear Algebra
Within the code base, the following methods are implemented in `math.linear.ts`.
